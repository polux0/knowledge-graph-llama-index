The \nspecification standard for a community-type society is divided \ninto a set of interrelated sub-systems that form a whole \nsocietal information system. The primary sub-systems of a \nsocietal system are: the social system; the [economic] decision \nsystem; the material system; and the lifestyle system. These \nsocietal systems categories apply to all types of societies; of \nwhich it is their internal configuration and emergently created \ninterrelationship that are observable as a type of society. \nAll societal systems may be sub-divided, for purposes of \nunderstanding, design, and adaptation, at these conceptions of \ncategorization. If society is a collaborative effort, then a common \nand unified information system is essential for appropriately \ninterpreting what is real with regularity. Commonality in \ngeneration and utilization of an information system allows for \nindividual subjects among a societal population to work with \none another to function better and to enhance the likelihood of survival and thriving; thus, linking self-interest to social-\ninterest (mutual self- and social- fulfillment). Through a unified \nmodel for the organization of information human fulfillment is \ncapable of being structurally attained.

This is the highest level model in \nthe societal framework. The model represents a formal \n\u201cmap\u201d by which the society structures information and \narrives at important decisions that involve the systems \nand resources of which the society is composed. As a \nmodel, it visualizes what information sets the society is \ncomposed of, and describes how the society is composed \nin terms of its high-level relationships. The primary inputs \nof the model include the societal systems common to \nevery type of society, and their direct sub-systems. The \nmodel presents these systems in their spiralling (helical) \ninterrelationship, depicting the potential for enabling \nthe spiralling evolution of the societal system, and \nits inhabitants. This type of societal design is superior \nto other models for it is subject to change as more \naccurate information becomes available. With iteration \ncomes the capacity for adaptive design, which may be \ndirected through an ability to orient by applying tools \nand strategies to current issues. The model represents \na common point of focus for a society (of the type \n\u2018community\u2019) as well as a structured [systems] approach \nfor accurately engaging with the real world. Essentially, \nthe Real World Community Model is the highest-level \nmodel representing the unified information system for \na community-type society, and it maps the scope of \nthe society\u2019s conception and data architecture; it is the \nmaster reference model for the society. That which is \nreal causes effects in the experiential, objective world. A \nunified societal information system relates all actions in \nsociety, because they are all interconnected. This model \ncan be used to understand and intentionally design any \ntype of society.\nA societal information system (SIS) is a system that \nprovides information for structuring, decisioning, and \ncontrol of the organization of a society. It structures the \ninformation set and information processing capability of \na society. Each event affecting the societal system and \nits inhabitants is assumed to have a probability of being \nprocessed correctly within the system, independent of \nprevious states of the system.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4855, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "node-1": {"__data__": {"id_": "node-1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "64fc2efd-5c66-4c2d-a768-916fa41a6957", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "593b8c2be3493597ebc7a1a8c2127059ab899ce67c4dc9d30bde84d95767854a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c82f13eb-cdfd-43c6-8ed9-8d3496694142", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc24561038f0d8507a9cc5b95d86ea6538575027924fd6c1a357e12c32eb1517", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "68904f8e-7537-4455-bd37-29e9397acf62", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5aef4d96e625e0735d216e68e08cc2de617c12c6af8a26105e8ad481f537885", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Essentially, \nthe Real World Community Model is the highest-level \nmodel representing the unified information system for \na community-type society, and it maps the scope of \nthe society\u2019s conception and data architecture; it is the \nmaster reference model for the society.

Each event affecting the societal system and \nits inhabitants is assumed to have a probability of being \nprocessed correctly within the system, independent of \nprevious states of the system.\nWhen the organization of a societal system is defined, \nthen individual users of the system have a greater \npotential for engagement with the system and with \nthe real world, since every society exists within the real \nworld, but not every society accounts for its presence. \nWhen navigating in reality, good decisions (as decisions \nthat create fulfilling state-dynamics for those navigating together) require accurate maps that layout the whole \nterrain of life. Maps are useful for deciding a course \nof travel (i.e., the journey to be travelled) and they \nfacilitate the arrival at decisions whose results maintain \ndesired characteristics and results of travel. Essentially, \nthe Real World Community Model is an information \nsystem\u2019s model for the semantic organization, storage, \nand processing of information at a societal level for \nindividual, social, and ecological concern about the real \nworld in which all humanity lives. \nNote that the term \u201creal world\u201d in the model\u2019s title is \na synonym for humanity\u2019s common reality - it is the real \nworld that everyone experiences, or has the conditional \npotential to experience, in common. Herein, there is not \n\u201cmy reality\u201d and \u201cyour reality\u201d; there is the/our experience \nof reality. This shared reality (existence) can be realized \nand accounted for by those within it, or not. In the reality \nof human embodied experience there is a world that \nremains stubbornly important, and it might be called, \n\u201cthe real world\u201d. The real world provides a reference for \nstability when a population navigates together. And, a \ncommunity is, in part, a population of people navigating \ntogether in common.\nIt is important for a population to note that in the \nreal and discoverable phenomenological world all \nsocietal models must be re-assessed and re-calibrated \nas new information becomes available. Further, when \ninvestigating how a system meets the real needs of \na population, then the whole of the system must be \naccounted for: the whole of the real world must be \nmodeled; there must exist a global accounting for \ninformation in the world space. By accounting for and \norganizing information about a common reality, a \npopulation of individuals becomes capable (i.e., creates \nthe shared potential) of arriving at decisions that lead \nthem, iteratively, to a higher and more optimal state \nof fulfillment. Society is, itself, a dynamic and iterative \nprocess (wherein, iteration is the repetition of a process).\nThe Real World Community model is a single model \nthat can be viewed from several perspectives, and \nis designed to reflect the operation of a society that \naccounts as coherently as possible for the real world. \nIt is built for a social population that has decided to \nnavigate the world together. This model contains \ninformation accumulated through the lived experience \nof a cooperative population. The model determines the \nperception and integration of new information and it \nfacilitates the creation of new knowledge.

The reality of an information \nsystem is that it evolves by reducing entropy. Therein, \nthe optimal configuration of a social system is that of \ncooperation, for cooperation reduces entropy. Therein, \nsocial interactions may be optimized when individuals \ncare about one another, and therefore, act thoughtfully \ntoward one another. A decrease in entropy means two \nthings: first, it means less chaos (less uncertainty); and \nsecond, it means more information is present in the \nsystem by which to arrive at more optimal solutions.

The service system(s) structure and \norganize the provisioning of fulfillment. \nSome societies do not seek to account for a sufficient \ntotality of the real world. When the real world is not \nsufficiently accounted for in the iterative design of a \nsocietal system, then human fulfillment and general \nhappiness will likely be left wanting. Additionally, there is \naccurate information to be gained about the real world, \nand there also is inaccurate information about the real \nworld. A community-type society requires accurate \ninformation about itself within the real world if it is to \nremain resilient and adaptive to an environment that \n\u201cdictates\u201d its survival and well-being.\nIf a system (or in the literature, \u2018agent\u2019 or \u2018constructor\u2019) \ndoes not accurately model its environment, then its \nreasoning, decisioning, and results will likely suffer. \nIn the real world, systems are surrounded by their \nenvironments, forming a cohesive whole, which can be \nmodeled and then dynamically simulated. Creatures \nthat are unable to successfully model the world around \nthem are likely to perish more quickly.

Some models are more accurate in their \ndescription of the real world than other models. A more \naccurate model is likely to disorient its users less (or \nnot at all) in their navigation within the real world, than \na highly inaccurate representation of the world. And \nfundamentally, all inaccurate models have the potential \nfor disorientating their users.

Simplistically, the \nsocial system = conception; the decision system = \ntime and conception selection; and the material \nsystem = location spatialization of conception at \ntime, now or then or when.\n2.\u2002The System Overview (SO; a.k.a., hypothetical \noverview) - The highest level model or theoretical \nview of the system. An overview of the whole \nsystem through its highest level theoretical model. \nTechnically speaking, the societal system can be \nmodeled at the highest level as an integration of \nall systems into a unified and adaptive information \nsystems model.\nFigure 38.

In part, this \ninformation model is called a \u201creal world\u201d model because \nit recognizes and accounts for the real world, and in \ndoing so it allows its user to generate greater resonant \nstates of harmony, which may appear, for example, as a \nmore aesthetic, intuitive, and flourishing environment.\n2.2 Feedback\nTogether, a society can build information systems and \nmachines that can make the measurements that remove \nthe potential for human bias and reduce the artificial \nlimitations that set human individuals in competition to \none another. When processing feedback for controlling \norientation, it is necessary to distinguish the source of \nthe information in order to distinguish the quality and \norganization of the data. Herein, more objective (Read: \ncommonly verifiable and visually understandable) \nsources mean, a higher quality of data. Verifiable sources \nmean a higher quality of data. And, visualizable sources \nmean a higher quality of data. Machines with open code \nmean a higher quality of data. It is through feedback \nthat adaptation can be usefully controlled.
